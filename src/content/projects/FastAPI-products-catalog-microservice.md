This project showcases the development of a products catalog microservice API for an e-commerce platform. Built with a focus on scalability and performance, the API leverages the following technologies:

FastAPI: A high-performance web framework for building APIs in Python. FastAPI simplifies API development with features like automatic data validation, automatic documentation generation, and dependency injection.
MongoDB: A NoSQL document database known for its flexibility and scalability. This project utilizes MongoDB to store product data due to its ability to handle diverse product structures and large datasets.
Beanie ODM: An Object Document Mapper (ODM) library that simplifies working with MongoDB in Python. Beanie provides an intuitive way to interact with MongoDB collections by mapping Python classes to document structures.
API Endpoints:

The API provides a set of well-defined endpoints for managing product information within the e-commerce platform. Functionality may include:

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for product data.
Filtering and searching products based on various criteria.
Pagination for retrieving large product datasets efficiently.
Testing:

The project prioritizes code quality and maintainability by employing PyTest, a popular Python testing framework. PyTest ensures the functionality of the API endpoints through comprehensive unit tests, guaranteeing reliable operation.

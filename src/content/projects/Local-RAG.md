This project demonstrates how to build a fully local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using powerful open-source tools. It leverages LangChain for orchestration, LangGraph for defining complex LLM workflows, HuggingFace Embeddings for document vectorization, Ollama for running local Large Language Models (LLMs), and ChromaDB as a local vector store. The system is served via a user-friendly chat interface built with Chainlit.

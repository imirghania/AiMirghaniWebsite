I'm Ahmed Mirghani, a passionate Python developer with an emphasis in Data Science. I'm particularly skilled in building end-to-end data science projects. Starting from wrangling raw data to models building and deployment.

My fascination with data science stems from my mathematical background, which fueled my curiosity toward exploring the underlying concepts behind intellegent systems. This curiosity led me later to pursue a Master's degree in Machine Learning and Data Analysis.

My skillset extends beyond the realm of data. I'm also comfortable building user-friendly web interfaces, APIs, and desktop applications and always eager to learn and expand my horizons.

Being a father has taught me valuable lessons about patience, creativity, and finding joy in the little things. In my free time, you'll find me reading a good book, indulging in some artistic expression through drawing, or staying active with some sports.

My blog serves as a platform to share notes on the things I learn, with an aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice. I'll strive to provide clear and actionable guides, walking through the code and practical considerations needed to bring these ideas to life.

So, whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, I invite you to join me on this journey as we learn together!
